{"name":"JavaScript function golf","tagline":"A framework that aims to only use functions and be short.","body":"**JavaScript function golf** is a framework for JavaScript that aims to only use functions and be short. In fact, it's a [golfing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) framework.\r\n\r\nJavaScript function golf is included into the page HTML, so use it right from the console!\r\n\r\n## Staff\r\n\r\nUser | Flair | Battle Call\r\n:-- | :--: | --:\r\n@schas002 | Founder | I made this for you!\r\n\r\n## Importing\r\n\r\nAdd function golf from HTML:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"http://schas002.github.com/js-function-golf/js-function-golf.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn [Programming Puzzles & Code Golf Stack Exchange](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/), function golf is quite tricky to score - if in doubt, please ask on [meta](http://meta.codegolf.stackexchange.com/).\r\n\r\nFrom JS, you can do this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndocument.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src = \"http://schas002.github.com/js-function-golf/js-function-golf.js\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nTheoretically, it is also possible to do this in function golf:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n_(\"http://schas002.github.com/js-function-golf/js-function-golf.js\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut importing function golf when function golf is already imported is overkill. :kappa:\r\n\r\nOr you can just download <http://schas002.github.com/js-function-golf/js-function-golf.js> and just import `http://path.to/js-function-golf.js` replacing the site `http://path.to/` with the directory where `js-function-golf.js` is.\r\n\r\n## Code golf rules\r\n\r\nCurrently the golden rule is, **only functions allowed are JS function golf functions**, so `i2s(123)` instead of `123.toString()`. The silver rule is, **attributes are not allowed and replaced by existing function golf functions**, so `sl(\"ABC\")` instead of `\"ABC\".length`. Any other structures of JS are allowed.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nLicensed under the ISC License.

The answer is either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\r\n\r\n#### Variations\r\n\r\n`yn2i` instead returns an integer (\"Yes\" is 1, \"No\" is 0).\r\n\r\n### `i(question)`\r\n\r\nAsks the user whatever you gave to `i` and returns the answer they gave. The answer is a string.\r\n\r\n#### Variations\r\n\r\n`iai` instead parses the answer as an integer that is returned.\r\n\r\n### `i2s(data)`\r\n\r\nConverts whatever you gave to `i2s` to a string.\r\n\r\n### `s2i(data)`\r\n\r\nConverts a string you gave to `s2i` to an integer.\r\n\r\n### `pr(number)`\r\n\r\nFinds if is whatever you gave to `pr` prime. Returns 1 if the number is prime, else 0.\r\n\r\n### `sl(data)`\r\n\r\nMeasures the length of the string you gave to `sl`.\r\n\r\n### `sloc(data, query)`\r\n\r\nThe `sloc()` method returns the index of (the position of) the first occurrence of a specified text in a string.\r\n\r\n### `siloc(data, query)`\r\n\r\nThe `siloc()` method returns the index of the last occurrence of a specified text in a string.\r\n\r\n### `ss(data, query)`\r\n\r\nThe `ss()` method searches a string for a specified value and returns the position of the match.\r\n\r\n### `ssl`, `subs`, `subsbl`\r\n\r\nThere are 3 methods for extracting a part of a string:\r\n\r\n- `ssl()` extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string. The method takes 3 parameters: the initial string, the starting index (position), and the ending index (position).\r\n\r\n- `subs()` is similar to `ssl()`. The difference is that `subs()` cannot accept negative indexes.\r\n\r\n- `subsbl()` is similar to `ssl()`. The difference is that the second parameter specifies the length of the extracted part.\r\n\r\n### `sr(data, query, replacement)`\r\n\r\nThe `sr()` method replaces a specified value with another value in a string.\r\n\r\n### `s2uc`, `s2lc`\r\n\r\nA string is converted to upper case with `s2uc()`.\r\n\r\nA string is converted to lower case with `s2lc()`.\r\n\r\n### `scc(first, second)`\r\n\r\n`scc()` joins two or more strings.\r\n\r\n### `scha`, `schca`\r\n\r\nThere are 2 safe methods for extracting string characters:\r\n\r\n- The `scha()` method returns the character at a specified index (position) in a string.\r\n\r\n- The `schca()` method returns the unicode of the character at a specified index in a string.\r\n\r\n### `sspl(data, separator)`\r\n\r\nA string can be converted to an array with the `sspl()` method.\r\n\r\n### `i2e(data, decimal)`\r\n\r\n`i2e()` returns a string, with a number rounded and written using exponential notation.\r\n\r\n### `i2fp(data, decimal)`\r\n\r\n`i2fp()` returns a string, with the number written with a specified number of decimals.\r\n\r\n### `i2p(data, length)`\r\n\r\n`i2p()` returns a string, with a number written with a specified length.\r\n\r\n### `s2f(data)`\r\n\r\n`s2f()` parses a string and returns a number. Spaces are allowed. Only the first number is returned.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
